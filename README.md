# OU-Gadget-Schedule-Folder

A custom OmniUpdate gadget created for our users.

### Goal

We needed a solution to schedule hundreds of pages within the same folder. Currently, OU is limited to scheduling one page at a time. This gadget detects the folder you are in within OU and allows you schedule every file.

## Install
 
- Follow typical [OU Gadget installation](https://support.omniupdate.com/learn-ou-campus/administration/setup/gadgets.html)
- Make any desired changes in config.xml
- Change to your site target in index.html
- Change hidden div to your site specifics
